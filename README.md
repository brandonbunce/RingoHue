# RingoHue

RingoHue allows you to control your Phillips Hue lights from your MAKERphone/Ringo with ease.

This application is a work in progress. Current goals include:
- Make full use of Phillips Hue v2 API.
- Be able to change target to any specific light, room or zone.
- Use color wheel similar to official Hue app to pick light color/temperature.
- Assign and use number buttons as shortcuts to scenes.
- Seamless integration with Ringo's operating system.
